# Android Dagger Example

This example code illustrates how to use Dagger to create a debug version of a class while developing a project, more information on the Degree53 blog: http://www.degree53.com/blog/2015/january/android-development-with-dagger

To switch between the release and debug variants you'll need to know about the Build Variants panel in Android Studio, see Figure 2 here: http://developer.android.com/tools/building/configuring-gradle.html
